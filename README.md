# Last Arbiter
***
- This is a rework of the Last Judge boss fight. 
- The boss is now faster, tankier, and some of its attacks have been tweaked to make it more difficult.
- The boss has balanced for when you would normally encounter it in a playthrough, not for maxed out saves.

## Installation

2. Run the game at least once to allow files to be generated.

- Located in the folder is a save file before the boss. It is user 3 by default but change it by renaming. Backup saves before just in case.
